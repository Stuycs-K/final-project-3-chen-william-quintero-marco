## Overview
Stuy Tower Defense is a tower defense game that progressively gets harder after every wave. Enemies based on school-related tasks will spawn from the left side of the screen and follow a set path to the end. If it reaches the end, the user will lose Base HP and once the user's Base HP reaches 0, the game is over. The goal is to prevent all of the enemies within a wave from reaching the goal. The user is in charge of placing towers that cost Cash to place down, which destroy the enemies within its effective radius in various ways. To match the increase in difficulty of enemies (more enemies, faster enemies, and enemies with more HP), towers can be upgraded with higher damage, greater radius, and faster attack speeds. Complete all 30 waves and win or die trying.

## Game and GameDemo Folder Instructions
1. The Game folder contains code for how the game is meant to be played, with the player starting off with 100 Base HP and $600 Cash. 
2. The GameDemo folder is for testing purposes and starts you off with a lot of Cash and Base HP. If you want to skip waves quickly, run the GameDemo folder. Then, before clicking start, press the E key to skip to the wave you want.

## Gameplay Instructions
1. Press the keys 1, 2, or 3 to choose which tower to select or alternatively, click on the tower sprite you want to select and then click the tile you want to place the tower on. The right side of the screen will display the name and stats of the tower currently selected.
2. Click on the placed tower that you want to upgrade and a menu at the bottom right of the map will pop up. The green button will allow you to upgrade the tower and the red will allow you to sell, removing it from the map. Click the red X at the top right or click the mob again to exit the menu.
3. Click the green button on the right corner of the screen to start a wave.
4. When all of the mobs are off the screen (whether they made it to the end or got destroyed), below the wave counter it will say the wave has ended and you can now press the green button to start on the next wave.
